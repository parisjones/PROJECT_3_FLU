# Data Visualization Project: Influenza Impact Analysis Across States

## Overview

In our Data Visualization project, we, Paris Jones, Keith Allen, Persistence Musiiwa, and Qasim Khilji, have embarked on an insightful journey to analyze and present the impact of influenza across various states in the US. Utilizing the FluView Dashboard from the CDC, our primary goal is to understand the prevalence of influenza and its varying impacts on different demographics, specifically focusing on state-wise and age-group distributions.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of our project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of influenza. By dissecting data state-by-state and across different age groups, we aim to offer valuable insights into the patterns and severity of influenza outbreaks. Our visualizations will highlight when and where the virus hits the hardest, empowering healthcare providers and policymakers with data-driven insights for better preparedness and response.

## Data Visualization Tools and Libraries

We have employed a variety of tools and libraries for our visualizations, including:

-   **Python Libraries**: Matplotlib, Pandas, and PySpark for extra points

Data for our project is sourced and managed using databases i.e PostgreSQL.

## Unique Features and Interactivity

Our project stands out due to its interactive elements. Users can engage with the data through:

-   Interactive HTML dropdown
-   Dynamic visualizations based on user-selected filters

These features ensure a user-friendly experience, allowing for personalized exploration of the data.

## Data Source

The data was sourced from the FluView Dashboard by CDC. We have powered our project with a dataset comprising way over 100 records/rows. While compiling and presenting this data, we have rigorously ensured that all ethical considerations are met. Our analysis respects privacy norms and focuses on delivering factual and unbiased insights.



## Conclusion and Acknowledgements

This project is a collaborative effort to shed light on the widespread impact of influenza. We extend our gratitude to the CDC for providing the FluView Dashboard as a primary data source. Our work also incorporates codes and methodologies referenced from various sources, all duly credited in our repository.

Explore our project and join us in understanding the nuances of influenza's impact across different states and age groups in the USA.
